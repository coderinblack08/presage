## Design Guidelines

Follow the colors and text styles from the Figma library/Tailwind config.

Here is the breakdown of the pages included in the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/IFAZsGG1ptOYlQiFQGO6lB/Presage-Design-System?node-id=28%3A0):

- Design System: Base styles (colors, typography, elements)
- Components: Well, components
- Mockup: Page designs

## Development

```bash
cd scrapper
yarn start

cd ../web
yarn dev
```

Setup .env accordingly (create Supabase project, their local cli is still in the workings)
